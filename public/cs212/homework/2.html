            Throughout time we see many architectural trends and fads, evolving off of
            previous concepts drawing similarities from other cultures and time
            periods. Behind history of these buildings and structures, we can see the
            history and that they were commonly impacted off of religious or
            philosophical concepts and ideals. In Ancient Egyptian culture we see a
            common structures and designs throughout. The building of pyramids started
            with the 3<sup>rd</sup> dynasty, approximately 2500 years before the birth
            of Christ and became popular monuments amongst Egypt’s dead royalty. These
            pyramids were built because of the unique positions royalty held in
            Egyptian culture. They were seen as chosen people by the gods themselves to
            server as middle men on earth. Due to this, the people believed it would be
            essential to keep these god chosen people preserved and honored in the
            highest form after their death. The ancient Egyptians also believed once
            their king died the spirit, popularly known as ka, was to stay in his body
            and in attempt to protect the spirit the body was mummified and ultimately
            preserved. It was also common practice to bury them with personally
            belongings and valuables. The first pyramid to be built is believed to be
            for King Djoser and was made a tradition following his death and the Great
            Pyramid of Giza built by Khufu is the most popular of all created.

            In classical architecture we see a similar theme. Commonly seen in various
            European empires and scenes like Greek, Romanesque, etc. This style was
            notably influenced by Greek architecture, this style was used in many
            constructions of religious buildings including churches. Other influences
            are seen from the Near East while going on to influence later orthodox
            architecture and buildings commonly seen in the modern day. The Byzantine
            Empire’s architecture was heavily inspired by the fallen Rome’s traditions,
            however architects also included something new These designers were widely
            recognized for their skill and took part in improving the design of the
            walls and domes seen in churches. They brought a new found interests for
            the inside of building just as much as the exterior. Instead of focusing
            solely on how the buildings look from the outside, Byzantine architects
            were seen ramping up designs for the interior as well. The main inspiration
            and push for this was Christianity, as we see these building being worked
            on were churches. The conversion to grand, domed ceilings is the biggest
            influence from the church, leaving old classical designs. Other influences
            seen from the Near East while going on to influence later orthodox
            architecture and buildings commonly seen in the modern day. The Hagia
            Sophie is a prime example of peak Byzantine architecture, design, and
            attention to detail. The dome shaped top is the cornerstone of Byzantine
            architecture while the interior also shows a great display of craftmanship.

            Renaissance Architecture, starting in approximately 1400A.D., we see
            architects stray away from the practices seen in Gothic style and steer
            towards classical pieces like domes and arches. The architecture seen in
            the Renaissance time period features walls decorated in motifs like
            columns, arches, and pillars to give the interior a better perception of
            depth. Similar to Byzantine Architecture, they are taking into account the
            interior just as much as the exterior in terms of design and planning. The
            San Pietro Church located in Montorio, Italy is a great example of
            renaissance architecture, featuring a domed ceiling and inspirations from
            Gothic and Byzantine structures. The interest and obsession with
            proportionally sound architecture resulted in spacious and well thought out
            structures straying away from the Gothic Practice. One of the biggest
            influences on this style was Leon Battista Alberti and his ten books
            dedicated to architecture.
