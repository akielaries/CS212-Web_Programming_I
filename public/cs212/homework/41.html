					<h1 class="section-heading">Author's Background</h1>

					<p>
					Ray Bradbury, born on August 7, 1920 and died on June 6, 2012, was a
					science fiction author who wrote novels that shaped the 20th and 21st
					century for their evoke of themes of censorship, threats of
					technology, racism, etc. Bradbury integrated his hobby for reading
					pulp magazines with his own speculations about the future in a style
					of poetic metaphors. He was able to be a fluid and successful writer
					without higher education; instead he read as many works as he could to
					exercise his imagination. These included works from Edgar Allan Poe,
					Ernest Hemmingway, and Thomas Wolfe. He expressed his appreciation for
					literature in his book Fahrenheit 451 in 1953. Fahrenheit 451 dealt
					with a world without literature, where every person thought alike and
					were prohibited to have outstandingly different views on matters of
					life. He was heavily influenced to write this book with inspiration
					from his childhood’s events; from living during World War Two to his
					relationship with his grandfather. Bradbury also wrote short stories
					that were included in “The Martian Chronicles” and “The Illustrated
					Man” where he touched on themes of the interaction of society with
					technology and psychology of people. The Martian Chronicles set
					creatures from Mars on Earth who try to find a way to live through
					conflicts among people from Earth. After Fahrenheit 451, Bradbury’s
					reputation allowed him for opportunities for new outlets for his
					imagination. He has been honored by his “contributions to American
					literature” (Jonas).

					<h1 class="section-heading">Social Context</h1>

					<p>
					Bradbury created the title of the book from the temperature at which
					paper burns : 451℉. The dystopian novel sets a time where people are
					prohibited to own or read books. “Firefighters” burn any book that
					they find or that people hide away. This is done to stop the spread of
					new ideas to keep people ignorant and controlled. Inspired by the
					censorship by the Nazi in WW2, Bradbury used this event in history to
					produce a story to expand on the rise of dictators who want to take
					complete control of their country and people’s mind. The rise of
					technological advances in the 20th century plays a major theme in
					Fahrenheit 451 to develop the possible threats that these advancements
					can force society to hide away from literature. The book hints that
					technology could be a distraction controlled by the government to keep
					the people ignorant and away from the “danger” of books. His work also
					warned citizens to fear the spread of communism in the U.S. by
					infiltrated communists in society who encouraged censorship. The novel
					accurately describes technologies half a century prior to our time now
					that TV and phone screens exist.

					<h1 class="section-heading">Major Themes</h1>

					<section class="section-highlighted">
						<h1 class="sub-heading">Censorship:</h1>

						<p>
						Literature is heavily censored and all books are banned and burned,
						the crux of Fahrenheit 451’s overarching story; how a fireman’s job
						has flipped from saving the world from fires into ridding the world
						of books and literature by setting them on fire. Indeed, Ray
						Bradbury feared such a notion of censorship was already well under
						way within the real world, as he displays through Montag's initial
						disposition of how he has never questioned the status quo (Bahrani).
						Yet, as the story goes on and Montag begins to transform, through
						such transformation, Bradbury asserts the glimmer of hope that's
						still present in the face of extreme censorship.
						</p>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h1 class="sub-heading">Knowledge vs. Ignorance:</h1>

						<p>
						The entirety of the story's plot revolves around the constant
						struggle between knowledge and ignorance. How it is the firemen's
						job to destroy books, promoting ignorance; how there is a secret
						network of people all over the country who remember pieces of
						literature, retaining books' value as repositories of knowledge; how
						Montag's inner conflict between ignorance and knowledge is resolved
						by those promoting knowledge, as they ignite a spark of doubt in
						Montag, resulting in knowledge being the victor via Montag's
						newfound pursuit of knowledge.
						</p>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h1 class="sub-heading">Role of Technology:</h1>

						<p>
						Bradbury paints the innovations in technology to be the catalyst for
						society’s issues, as such innovations have fostered a mass addiction
						to entertainment. How Montag accredits his wife’s emotional
						disconnection to technology, as she remains plugged into some form
						of entertainment at all times. Furthermore, nuclear technology
						becomes the be-all and end-all, as an atomic bomb destroys
						everything Montag once knew; indeed, Bradury asserts the notion of
						technology’s egregious, inherent destructive aspect, as it destroys
						entire societies along with the spread of knowledge.
						</p>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h1 class="sub-heading">Dissatisfaction:</h1>

						<p>
						Another factor that may be accredited to the social decline of
						reading is dissatisfaction. Of course, such dissatisfaction ties
						back in with the role of technology and censorship: how censorship
						has promoted the dissatisfaction with books being overwhelming and
						too offensive; and how technology has fostered a constant need for
						more, better, and innovative ways of consuming entertainment.

					<h1 class="section-heading">Analysis of Major Characters</h1>

					<section>
						<h1 class="sub-heading">Guy Montag:</h1>

						<p>
						Mostly known by Montag, Guy Montag is the main character of
						Fahrenheit 451. Montag is an ordinary civilian in the alternate
						American Society that Ray Bradbury built for this novel; he burns
						books for no other reason than: “Books are bad!” However, when
						Montag witnesses an innocent lady burned with her books, Montag
						begins to fall away from society.
						</p>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h1 class="sub-heading">Captain Beatty:</h1>

						<p>
						The antagonist, the anti-Montag — along with everyone else in
						society — and the embodiment of censorship in Fahrenheit 451,
						Captain Beatty, thought to be a trustworthy acquaintance and boss,
						Montag finds that Beatty is his greatest enemy. From one
						perspective, Beatty’s character is a metonymy for government; for,
						the government is never actually seen or referred to, Beatty plays
						into the government’s efforts to keep people away from text that
						will inflict emotion or thinking or promote superiority in society
						by trying to keep Montag form reading and dispelling the insides to
						the rest of the society. From another perspective, Beatty acts as a
						child playing with a couple of bugs, or their rodent pet,
						constricting Montag’s range of wander. Everytime Montag begins to
						consider the idea of books and the effects of reading, Beatty slaps
						his hand down, closing off Montag’s pathway, forcing Montag to
						return to his place and find a different path.
						</p>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h1 class="sub-heading">Clarisse McClellan:</h1>

						<p>
						Clarisse, she is only around for a short time, but she leaves a
						lasting impression. Clarisse is the first character we meet.
						Considering the world around her, she is crazy, abnormal,
						non-conformant to the expectations of society, and it is the first
						time that Montag meets Clarisse that his perception begins to
						change; however, with Clarisse’s death, solidifies Montag’s
						perception of something being wrong with the world, and, more
						importantly, the burning of books.
						</p>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h1 class="sub-heading">Professor Faber:</h1>

						<p>
						Introduced half way through, Professor Faber is the essential piece
						to make Montag realize that there is something very wrong with
						burning books; consequently, Faber is the aid that brings Montag to
						expose this problem in society in a negative fashion: Having
						firemen, just doing their jobs, lose their houses and wives, and
						whatever else, because they do not understand; contrary to the
						philosophies of Granger.
						</p>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h1 class="sub-heading">Mildred Montag:</h1>

						<p>
						Known as Millie to Guy Montag, Mildred is Montag’s wife; however, as
						the book progresses, Mildred becomes more of a husk than the woman
						she once was to Montag. An empty body who has been consumed by the
						fast pace of the society, and unwilling to consider the possibility
						of stepping away to think and process. Considering this, Mildred
						functions as support for Bradbury’s assertion on the role of
						technology: Giving into the control that technology has gained on
						citizens.
						</p>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h1 class="sub-heading">Granger:</h1>

						<p>
						Granger, introduced at the end, proposes to Montag that his reading
						and his escape were not in vain, for humanity will end itself and
						will have to restart, and those who survived the end will be there
						to pass down the knowledge with held in books to the generations to
						come.

					<h1 class="section-heading">Analysis of Major Literary Devices</h1>

					<p>
					“It was a pleasure to burn. It was a special pleasure to see things
					eaten, to see things blackened and changed.” (Bradbury 3).
					</p>

					<p>
					Immediately, Bradbury presents the reader with the main point of
					contention within the dystopian world he has created: how the society
					of such a world perceives book burning, the spread of ignorance, as a
					pleasure. Such an immediate introduction to this dystopian premise,
					then, establishes the story’s overarching gloomy, hopeless tone, as
					Bradbury asserts his fears of the real-world society being gripped by
					the promotion of ignorance (Bahrani). Furthermore, Bradbury uses the
					futuristic premise to his advantage, as the ever lingering threat of
					another nuclear war, due to the innovative advances in nuclear
					technology, fosters the apocalyptic atmosphere, furthering the
					intensity of the tone. And as the story’s tone intensifies, so do its
					prevalent how: how the symbolisms of fire take hold of the story’s
					constant conflict between ignorance and knowledge.
					</p>

					<p>
					Fire presents itself countless times, with differing undertones. The
					beginning of the book, Montag loves the qualities of fire. Mid way
					through, he experiences the destructive properties; sorrow would best
					characterize this undertone. Near the end, when Montag runs away, he
					destroys his own home and kills his team of firemen. The most notable
					quality of these events is fire’s destruction, and the use of fire by
					man; Bradbury plays off this image to foreshadow Granger’s comment at
					the end. Humanity is shown burning its pyre, and the surviving groups
					are a metaphor for the Phoenix, rising from the ashes, reconstructing
					his pyre for the next few hundred years.

				<h1 class="section-heading">Addendum</h1>

				<section>
					<h1 class="sub-heading">Fonts</h1>

					<p>
						So, the fonts I chose do not really fall within the general set of
						fonts that normally appear on the webpages. This is because as I was
						browsing Font Squirrel for fonts, it dawned on me that Fahrenheit
						451, the book the webpage is about, is an old book by now. From this
						I thought, "What if this was some essay some guy in the Middle Ages
						decided to write to his friend to tell the friend about this
						intersting book he just read." Of course, I know Fahrenheit 451 is
						not that old of a book, but just to give some background to why the
						font is what I chose to make it; so that is why I chose the
						"Florante-at-Laura" and "Quintessential" fonts; to kind of sell the
						idea that this is a document being written by hand with a quil.
						I also like the cool letter shapes that calligraphy produces, and I
						thought to spice up my essay, why not use calligraphic fonts?
					</p>

					<p>
						Speaking of calligraphy and the two fonts I chose, why did I choose
						two fonts? Simply put, normally calligraphy is reserved for titling
						things such as birthday cards, the title on the front cover of a
						book, or the first letter in a paragraph in an old book or document.
						That was the feel I was going for; I figure the title and each
						section and sub heading are important things someone would want to
						use calligraphy to highlight. And then, by this logic, I figure my
						character would not be using such extravegant hand writing for just
						writing, so they he switches to a more colloquial hand writing;
						although, I also figure people in the Middle Ages were taught to
						write with a little more fanciness and form than what we learn
						today. Hence, the still fanciful paragraph font.
					</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h1 class="sub-heading">Font Size and Weight</h1>

					<p>
						Depending on if the person grading my webpage is the same who graded
						my submission for homework 2, you may have noticed that the font
						size of all the text has gotten bigger. If you are not the same
						person: the font size changed.
					</p>

					<p>
						But you did not come here to have the obvious pointed out, you came
						here to grade, so why did I increase the font size of all the text?
						There is a simple answer: I like big text. The longer answer is,
						though I did not have a problem reading the text on the screen, I
						still was compelled to squint. I do not know about you, but I like
						to avoid straining my eyes as much as possible, so I increased the
						font size.
					</p>

					<p>
						You may also notice that the text in paragraph elements appears to
						be bolded even though all the content certainly is not that
						important, right? Well you would be right. However, after choosing
						my fonts, I did find that the letters were just a little too skinny
						to read very easily, so I went ahead and increased the font weight
						so that the text was more broad, and would still sort of jump off
						the page without having to squint.
					</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h1 class="sub-heading">Background and Text Color</h1>

					<p>
						As I had this sudden inspiration of why my webpage's story was, I
						figured, "Well, if this is a guy from the Middle Ages writing to his
						friend, he must be writing this on sheep's skin or parchment," so to
						sell this idea of this being an old document, I went ahead and chose
						a background color I though most closely resembled sheep's skin, and
						left the text color as black as a sign that this was written with
						black ink.
					</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h1 class="sub-heading">Line Height and Word Spacing</h1>

					<p>
						I bet it is obvious by now that I am a person who loves readability.
						I mention this because, if you have not noticed, I bumped up the
						space between lines of text in paragraph elements a little bit.
						While deciding how I wanted to style my essay, I was really hung up
						on people being able to easily differentiate between lines. I know I
						have a hard time with jumping across lines when I am reading small,
						squished together text, so I increased the line height to improve
						readability and improve the differentiability between lines if
						someone does happen to get turned around while reading.
					</p>

					<p>
						Among the formating changes I made to the paragraph element, you may
						have noticed that each letter has its own amount of space between it
						and the other word. After choosing my found, I realized that the
						letters were also too close together for me to easily read without
						straining my eyes, so I decided to bump up and put some space
						between each letter. This way words are not just clumped together.
					</p>

					<p>
						After reflecting on my choice to increase the line height and word
						spacing values, and after realizing the story I wanted my webpage to
						have, I realize that the choices I made also add to the character I
						have fabricated whom is writing this essay. I inadvertantly built
						personality into my character because I wanted readability, and I
						did not even notice it. Just Something I found interesting. And am
						claiming as a purposful and novel idea I had and planned for. If I
						could put in a "rofl" emote, I would put it right here -> {rofl}
					</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h1 class="sub-heading">Indentaiont ( Padding on the left )</h1>

					<p>
						Being a programmer since my first year of high school, I have
						developed an afinity for indentaion levels and object inheretence.
						I really like how you cannot mistake indented information for being
						related to anything else but the thing it falls under in the
						indentation hierarchy of a script. I guess that really goes for
						white space sensitive languages like Python. Still, that is the same
						reason why my HTML code strictly follows an indentation hierarchy.
						But more than that, I like that you cannot mistake the information
						held within, let's say a Java class, for being related to anything
						else but the class the object inherets from. So, I applied these
						same ideas to my webpage structure. The title of the essay contains
						all the content in the essay, so you know nothing in the essay will
						be out of the scope of what the essay's title implies. So the title
						is on the first indentation level with no padding, and then I
						applied this same structure to section headings, sub headings, and
						paragraphs. So paragraphs inheret their language from a sub heading
						because a sub heading defines everything the paragraph under them
						talks about. Sub headings inheret their language from the section
						headings, and the section headings inheret their language from the
						title to prompt the reader that the next indentation level will be
						talking about the next topic of the essay.
					</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h1 class="sub-heading">Underlining</h1>

					<p>
						So, mayber I'll lose point, but going into this homework, I knew I
						wanted to use what I have learned about the CSS Box Model to
						"underline" my title. The primary goal of creating this underline is
						just to add a little more substance to my webpage - add an imbalance
						between the title and the various levels of headings. The other
						reason is, so I am able to solidify my understanding of the CSS Box
						Model and practice manipulating the different attributes of the box
						which the content resides. Granted, now the border is not really a
						"border".
					</p>

					<p>
						Additionally, since I do not have an intention to indent the section
						headings, I think it is important to make a differentiation between
						the title and the section headings. I know, I am steering away from
						my indentation levels and inherentence with this choice. Do not
						worry.
					</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h1 class="sub-heading">Width</h1>

					<p>
						While on the topic of how I went about styling the title, you
						probably noticed the underline extends a bit further than the title.
						This was purposful. Normally I enjoy symmetry, however, somtimes I
						find asymetrical things to be even more appealing. Why? Honestly, I
						do not even know the answer to that one, but that is another reason
						why I used the bottom of the border of the box where the title
						resides because I like the astetic of having just a bit more of a
						line than you actually need, and I was not savy enough to find a way
						to get the underline text decoration to extend like I got the border
						to.
					</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h1 class="sub-heading">Italicizing</h1>

					<p>
						You may have noticed that I included a bibliography. After all, that
						is what you put together when you are needing to reference someone's
						own ideas as you write, right? Well, yes. The problem is, with HTML
						I could not properly set up my bibliography to reflect a proper MLA
						standards. However, now that we are allowed to use CSS, I thought
						this would be an excellent opportunity to, at least, make an italics
						selector to finally properly italicize my citations, and so that I
						no longer have to turn the italicize tag to italicize what I want
						to; although, I should not have used the italicize tag in the first
						place.

        <h1 class="section-heading">HTML Abuse</h1>

				<section>
					<h1 class="sub-heading">The &lt;i&gt; tag</h1>

	        <p>
	          Unfortunately, I did use the &lt;i&gt; tag purly for its
	          stylistic contribution. I created italicized elements for each of
						the names of the characters in the character analysis section of
						this essay to add some differentiation because I was using these as
	          headings, yet I should have listened to Nakai when he said that tags
	          such as &lt;i&gt; are bad tags to use.
        	</p>

        	<p>
          	On the bright side that's the only miss use I see in my webpage.
